# Databricks Replication Steps

This is run in conjunction with the Airflow DAGS, so those need to be setup before this can be run. 

If you already have a Databricks setup, just move the notebooks into the Workspace > Repos > <email> directory, 
and set up the connection to Databricks from the Airflow tasks. Otherwise, follow the steps to create a Databricks account with cloud access to be able to 
utilize the compute steps defined in the notebooks.
