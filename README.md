This repository contains all code for our end-to-end big data pipeline, from ingestion into the landing zone up to data consumption. Each directory contains a separate part of our pipeline. To replicate each step, open each directory to view a README containing instructions to set them up.

**FOR SDM, the graph analytics dashboard is found in streamlit_dashboard, while flask_website contains our simple graph-based itinerary recommendation system.**

## Directory Structure

- **airflow_deployment**: Airflow DAGs and GCS Deployment Files
- **databricks_notebooks**: Databricks notebooks for data processing
- **flask_website**: Flask web application for serving the Tripify app
- **kafka_streams**: Kafka streaming scripts and configs
